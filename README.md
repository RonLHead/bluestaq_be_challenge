# Bluestaq Back-End Technical Challenge

### This application was created to submit as a back-end technical challenge for a SWE position at Bluestaq.

This project was bootstrapped with:
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## Technical challenge

The Elevator

1. Provide code that simulates an elevator.  You may use any language (recommend using Java or Python).
2. Please upload your code Git Hub for a discussion during your interview with our team. 
3. Additionally, document all assumptions and any features that weren't implemented. 
4. Please be prepared to discuss the assumptions and features that were not implemented during your interview!


## Assumptions and features not implemented

- **Elevator maximum weight capacity** - elevators usually have a maximum amount of weight that they can handle. A future feature would be to set the maximum weight capacity of the elevator, to check what the current weight is, and whether it can handle more weight.
- **Waiting for the elevator** - another feature to add is factoring the waiting a user will experience as the elevator moves to their current floor.
- **Number of requests** - it is feasible that an elevator will have multiple floor requests while in motion. A future feature should consider adding all floor requests in an array, then remove each request as they are completed.
